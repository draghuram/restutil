= Restutil

This project contains few wrapper scripts on top of curl to facilitate 
dealing with REST APIs from command line. 

== Usage

By default, all the API calls are made to `http://localhost:8080` but
that can be changed by setting the environment variable `RESTSERVER`. 

The following examples assume that a REST service to manage "notes" is
available at `http://localhost:8080`.

----
# Get list of notes
$ restget api/notes

# Get a particular note
$ restget api/notes/10

# Create a note
$ cat /tmp/example_note.txt | restpost api/notes

# Update a note
$ cat /tmp/example_note.txt | restput api/notes/10

# Delete a note
$ restdel api/notes/10

# Talk to REST server at a non-default location
$ RESTSERVER=https://www.example.com restget api/notes

# Passing a custom header
$ CURLOPTS="-H X-Custom_Header: value" restget api/notes
----

== Notes

The scripts require "python" and "curl" to be available in PATH.
